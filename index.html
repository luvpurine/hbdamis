                Scarlett, <br>
                Happy belated 16th birthday! I'm very sorry it took so long, as I've been wanting to make something like this for a while
                and your birthday was the perfect chance to do so. Anyways, I've always admired you Scarlett, if I haven't made it obvious
                already. You're one of the most compassionate people I know, and you always find a way to see the good in people's hearts.
                I also love to listen to what you have to say; you talk so openly and honestly, it makes me feel important to you. You're 
                very important to me too. I heard it's wrong to comment on someone's physical appearance, but I think this is okay: you 
                remind me a lot of beautiful, yet ordinary things. It's like, seeing something everyday, yet still appreciating its existence
                at the same level every time. Very timeless? Please don't take offense to this, but it's like: the light above the kitchen 
                stove, black tea, a wooden bench, cinnamon rolls, a bar of chocolate, loafers, and daylight on a cloudy day. I like it a lot, 
                and I hope that you do too. I would like to add that even when I act like you're saying something weird (i.e. the biker thing),
                I secretly enjoy what you're saying. But you'll probably never get me to say that so HA! I'm glad you're 16 now, it's a sign 
                that we'll keep on being friends for a long time. I hope you like this "gift" and have an amazing day!
                <br><br>
                ton amie, Leah
